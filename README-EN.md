Not just a launcher.


"Bene" is typically known as "Bene Desktop" or "Bene Launcher".   
However, "Bene" is more than just a launcher.   
We strive to be your everyday smart assistant for using your mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, efficiently.   
When you regularly use different devices, we hope that "Bene" can eradicate the sense of fragmentation from switching between devices and unify your user experience.

## Application Introduction
Do you ever feel like the number of apps on your devices (phones, tablets) keeps increasing, but you use them less and less frequently?  
Do you ever feel like the apps on your devices build walls, act independently, and lack coordination with each other?  
Do you ever feel like you're using a smartphone, but the behavior of these apps makes you feel like you're using an old-fashioned feature phone?  

You can't help but ask:  
Am I constantly bothered by organizing these apps, as if I'm being driven by them?  
There are some infrequently used apps that run in the background, can I uninstall them?  
Is the device controlling me, or am I in control of the device?  
Am I really the master of my device?  



***Break the boundaries of the apps, I am the master of the device!***  
With this vision, I strive to develop "Bene" as an application that liberates you from a multitude of apps and truly empowers you to take control of your device.
